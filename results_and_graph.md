# Results and Graph Concept

## Observation
Increase in vehicles leads to higher CO₂ emission.

## Project Claim
Implementation of green systems can reduce emissions moderately.

## Graph Idea
X-axis: Number of Vehicles
Y-axis: CO₂ Level

Trend:
- Increasing curve without system
- Slightly reduced curve with SUPGS model
