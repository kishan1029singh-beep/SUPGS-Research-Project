# SUPGS Research Project

## Introduction
SUPGS (Sustainable Urban Planning using Green Systems) is an independent student research project exploring how computational thinking and natural environmental systems may help reduce CO₂ emissions in urban areas.

This project represents an early-stage learning and research effort connecting environmental understanding with basic computational modeling.

---

## Project Idea
Increasing vehicle numbers contribute to rising carbon emissions in cities.  
This project studies a simplified model where natural green systems and planning strategies may help reduce emissions by approximately 10–15%.

The aim is exploration and learning, not claiming a final real-world solution.

## What This Repository Contains
- Research concept explanation
- Methodology description
- Early simulation approach
- Basic Python implementation

---

## Method Overview
1. Assume vehicle growth trend
2. Model CO₂ increase logically
3. Apply green-system reduction factor
4. Compare emission trends

---

## Coding Implementation
File: co2_graph.py

This Python script generates a simple comparison graph showing:
- CO₂ growth without intervention
- CO₂ trend with the SUPGS model

---

## How to Run
Requirements:
Python 3 and matplotlib library

Run the program using:
python co2_graph.py

---

## Project Status
This project is currently in the learning and early research stage.

Future improvements may include:
- Real-world dataset integration
- Improved simulation models
- Advanced computational analysis
