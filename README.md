# SUPGS – Student Universal Problem Guiding System

## Overview
SUPGS is an independent research-based project developed to explore how computational thinking and algorithmic logic can help in solving complex real-world problems.

This project focuses on building a structured framework that guides problem-solving using logical decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic reasoning.

## Project Goal
The goal of SUPGS is to design a system that:
- Breaks complex problems into smaller logical units
- Applies algorithmic reasoning
- Provides structured solution pathways

## Motivation
Coming from a rural background, this project represents self-driven learning and research exploration in Computer Science without institutional resources.

## Features
- Problem decomposition model
- Logical workflow structure
- Algorithm-based reasoning approach
- Research-oriented design

## Tech Concept (Learning Phase)
- Python (basic implementation)
- Algorithmic Thinking
- Computational Logic

## Status
This project is currently in the research and early implementation stage.

## Future Plans
- Add Python implementations
- Improve algorithm structure
- Build prototype system
- Publish research documentation

## License
This project is shared for academic and research purposes.
