# Methodology

## Data Assumption
- Vehicle growth increases CO₂ emission
- Natural green coverage reduces carbon concentration

## Approach
1. Estimate vehicle growth trend
2. Model CO₂ increase
3. Apply green system correction factor
4. Compare emission reduction

## Expected Reduction
Approximately 10–15% reduction using natural processes.
